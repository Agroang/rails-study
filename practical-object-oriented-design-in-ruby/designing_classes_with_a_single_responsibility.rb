# The foundation of an object-oriented system is the message, but the most
# visible organizational structure is the class.

# Your application needs to work right now just once; it must be easy to change
# forever. This quality of easy changeability reveals the craft of programming.
# Achieving it takes knowledge, skill, and a bit of artistic creativity.

# Design is more the art of preserving changeability than it is the act of
# achieving perfection.

# Code should be:

# Transparent: The consequences of change should be obvious in the code that is
# changing and in distant code that relies upon it.

# Reasonable: The cost of any change should be proportional to the benefits the
# change achieves.

# Usable: Existing code should be usable in new and unexpected contexts.

# Exemplary: The code itself should encourage those who change it to perpetuate
# these qualities.

# Code that is Transparent, Reasonable, Usable, and Exemplary (TRUE) not only
# meets today’s needs but can also be changed to meet the needs of the future.
# The first step in creating code that is TRUE is to ensure that each class has
# a single, well defined responsibility.

# A class should do the smallest possible useful thing; that is, it should have a
# single responsibility.

# Applications that are easy to change consist of classes that are easy to
# reuse. Reusable classes are pluggable units of well-defined behavior that have
# few entanglements. An application that is easy to change is like a box of
# building blocks; you can select just the pieces you need and assemble them in
# unanticipated ways.

# You increase your application’s chance of breaking unexpectedly if you depend
# on classes that do too much.
